#DEFINING FUNCITONS I
# todo: define a function named `population_density` that takes two arguments,
# `population` and `land_area` (in square kilometres), and returns a population
# density calculated from those values.


# Your code goes here!
def population_density(population, land_area):
    return population / land_area


# Here are test cases to verify that your function works as expected:
test1 = population_density(10, 1)
expected_result1 = 10
print("expected result: {}, actual result: {}".format(expected_result1, test1))

test2 = population_density(864816, 121.4)
expected_result2 = 7123.6902801
print("expected result: {}..., actual result: {}".format(expected_result2, test2))

# DEFINING FUNCTIONS II
# Write your code for readable_timedelta here.
def readable_timedelta(days):
    ''' returns a str of days in delta format.

    days: a int of the total days
    '''
    weeks_delta = days // 7
    days_delta = days % 7
    return "{} week(s) and {} day(s).".format(weeks_delta, days_delta)


# call to test it:
print(readable_timedelta(10))

# CODE WITH BRANCHES I
#First Example - uncomment lines or change values to test the code
phone_balance = 7.62
bank_balance = 104.39
#phone_balance = 12.34
#bank_balance = 25
if phone_balance < 10:
    phone_balance += 10
    bank_balance -= 10
print(phone_balance)
print(bank_balance)

#Second Example

#change the number to experiment!
number = 145346334
#number = 5 #3 sir
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number " + str(number) + " is even.")
else:
    print("The number " + str(number) + " is odd.")

#Third Example

#change the age to experiment with the pricing
